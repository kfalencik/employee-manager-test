## Frontend Project

### Welcome
Thank you for considering me for this position. I have created this app based on the technical brief I was provided.

### Setup
1. npm install (or npm i)
2. npm run serve

### Requirements
#### Background
StaffCircle deals with customers who have their employee data stored on our platform.
HR Managers (and their teams) need to be able to find employees by their manager, as well as view useful summarised data of their employee demographics.

#### Stories
1. As a user I must be view a list of employees.
2. As a user I must be able to filter the list of employees by manager and/or site (office/location).
3. As a user I must be able to sort the data by Full Name, date of birth, start date, manager and site (office/location).
4. As a user I must be able to easily view a break-down of the employees demographics by length of service in blocks of years (less than a year, 1 to 2 years, 2 to 5 years, more than 5 years).

### Things I would do/fix/optimise if I had more time
1. Check app on all browsers and devices
2. Write some unit tests (although most components are from Vuetify anyways)
3. Check performance and see if there is anything to optimise (there always is)
4. Write my own data formatter instead of using library
5. Demographics statistics is a bit messy and hard to read. Would definitely like to refactor that

### Outro
If you have any questions please don't hesistate to email me at - kfalenick@gmail.com
