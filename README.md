## Frontend Project

### Welcome
Thanks for speaking with the team at StaffCircle, and agreeing to show us your awesome dev skills.

This project is a opportunity to show us your strengths and demonstrate what you feel you can bring to the team and product.

The aim of this project is to help you demostrate your frontend skills.

Rather than prescribe a list of tasks, we are keen to see how you approach a real world set of requirements. With this in mind the project has a set of documented requirements (details below) with some minor guidance around approach as we don't want this to take you all night.

Complete as many of the requirements as you can, and then we will review the code, giving you the opportunity to share your reasoning behind your implementation and for our team to share any feedback they have.

### Setup
1. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/)

All resources required are available for free.

### Solution
1. UI Website
A VueJs single page application (SPA) being used to host the user interface. To run the project, run the following commands from the command line in the root directory:
    ```bash
	npm i
	npm run serve
	```

### Requirements
#### Background
StaffCircle deals with customers who have their employee data stored on our platform.
HR Managers (and their teams) need to be able to find employees by their manager, as well as view useful summarised data of their employee demographics.

#### Stories
1. As a user I must be view a list of employees.
2. As a user I must be able to filter the list of employees by manager and/or site (office/location).
3. As a user I must be able to sort the data by Full Name, date of birth, start date, manager and site (office/location).
4. As a user I must be able to easily view a break-down of the employees demographics by length of service in blocks of years (less than a year, 1 to 2 years, 2 to 5 years, more than 5 years).

#### Resources
We know there may be a few new bits of tech in here so here are a set of resources that should help you fulfill the users requirements.
1. [VueJs](https://vuejs.org/)
2. [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/)
3. [Employee data](https://api.jsonbin.io/b/5e8f3cde8e85c84370132fbd/6) - this is the end-point to use, along with the API key
